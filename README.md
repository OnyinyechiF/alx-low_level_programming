#Alx Low Level Programming#

This repository contains code examples and notes for alx low level programming. Low level programming involves working with computer hardware and software at a low level, closer to the machine code that runs on the computer's processor. This includes programming in assembly language, working with memory and pointers, and understanding how the operating system interacts with the hardware.

Each directory contains a README file with more information on the code examples and notes in that directory.
